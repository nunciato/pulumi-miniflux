# miniflux

An example of running a [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) RSS server on AWS with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com/).

[![Deploy](https://get.pulumi.com/new/button.svg)](https://app.pulumi.com/new)

☝️ Click that button and follow the instructions to set one up for yourself!

All you'll need is an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and these two standard AWS environment variables (so `pulumi` can deploy into AWS on your behalf):

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[your-aws-key]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[your-aws-secret]
```

Have fun! Hi!
